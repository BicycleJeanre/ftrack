# Getting Started

## 1.0 Getting Started

A budget is your financial roadmap. It helps you plan your income and expenses so you can see if your money will last through the month, and identify where you can save. FTrack makes this simple by letting you forecast multiple scenarios and compare them side-by-side.

## 1.1 What Is A Scenario

A scenario is a financial plan. You might have a baseline scenario showing your current reality, plus scenarios for "if I save $200 per month" or "if I get a raise". Each scenario contains the same accounts, but with different transactions and projections.

## 1.2 Step By Step Build Your First Budget

1. **Create a scenario**: Click the Forecast button, then create a new scenario named "My Budget" and set the type to Budget.
2. **Add your accounts**: List the accounts where your money lives such as Checking, Savings, Credit Card. Enter each account current balance.
3. **Add your income**: Create a Planned Transaction for your paycheck. Set it to recur weekly or monthly depending on your pay schedule.
4. **Add your expenses**: Add Planned Transactions for recurring expenses like rent, utilities, groceries, and subscriptions. Use recurrence for monthly or weekly bills.
5. **Configure recurrence**: For repeating payments, set them to recur on the correct day each week or month.
6. **Run a projection**: Click Generate Projections to see your forecasted balances over the next 90 days.
7. **Review and adjust**: Look at the projection. If your balance goes negative, adjust your spending or add more income until it looks sustainable.
8. **Save your plan**: Your budget is automatically saved. You can now track it and compare it to actual spending.

## 1.3 Pro Tips For Beginners

- **Start simple**: Do not worry about every small expense. Focus on the big items first such as rent, paycheck, major bills.
- **Keep one baseline**: Always have one scenario that matches reality. Use it to compare what-if scenarios against.
- **Recurrence is your friend**: Most expenses are monthly or weekly. Use recurrence so you do not have to enter each payment manually.
- **Log actuals regularly**: Once a week, mark transactions as actual to see how your real spending compares to your plan.
- **Adjust as needed**: Your budget is not set in stone. Update it when your situation changes such as raise, new expense.
