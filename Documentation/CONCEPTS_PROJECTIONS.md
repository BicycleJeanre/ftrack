# Projections Guide

## 1.0 Projections Guide

## 1.1 Understanding Projections

- **Forecast grid**: See projected account balances over time.
- **How they work**: Start with current balance, add income, subtract expenses.
- **Recalculate**: Refresh projections after any change.
- **Scenario comparison**: Validate which plan is most sustainable.

## 1.2 Generating Projections

Projections show you where your finances are headed based on your planned transactions and account balances.

1. Ensure all your accounts and planned transactions are set up correctly.
2. Click Generate Projections in the Forecast view.
3. Select the projection period, typically 90 days.
4. Review the projected balances for each account.
5. Identify any accounts that go negative or reach critical levels.
6. Adjust transactions or income as needed to improve the forecast.

## 1.3 Interpreting The Projection Grid

The projection grid displays each account as a column and each time period as a row. Each cell shows the projected balance at that point in time.

- Red values indicate negative balances, overspending.
- Green values indicate positive balances, healthy savings.
- Watch for trends: steadily declining or rising balances indicate unsustainable patterns.
- Compare multiple scenarios to find the most sustainable plan.

## 1.4 Refining Your Projections

Projections are only as good as your data. Here is how to improve accuracy.

- Keep account balances current, weekly updates.
- Review and update planned transactions regularly.
- Use recurrence for all repeating payments.
- Add periodic changes for salary increases or known expense changes.
- Compare projections to actuals and adjust the plan accordingly.

## 1.5 Scenario Comparison

Create multiple scenarios with different assumptions to compare outcomes.

- **Baseline**: Your expected reality.
- **Conservative**: Higher expenses, lower income.
- **Optimistic**: Lower expenses, higher income.
- **What-if**: Test specific changes like a new job or expense.
