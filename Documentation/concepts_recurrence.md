# Recurrence And Scheduling

## 1.0 Recurrence And Scheduling

## 1.1 Recurrence Patterns

- **One-time**: Transactions that happen only once.
- **Weekly**: Specify days of the week such as every Monday and Friday.
- **Monthly**: Specific day of month such as 15th or nth weekday such as first Tuesday.
- **Quarterly**: Same patterns as monthly, applied every 3 months.
- **Yearly**: Specific month and day such as December 25th.

## 1.2 Setting Up Recurrence

Recurrence allows you to define repeating transactions once and have them automatically apply across your projection period.

## 1.3 One Time Transactions

Select None for recurrence. The transaction will occur only on the date you specify.

## 1.4 Weekly Recurrence

Choose the days of the week the transaction occurs.

- Paycheck: Every Friday
- Gym visits: Monday, Wednesday, Friday
- Gas: Every Tuesday

## 1.5 Monthly Recurrence

You have two options for monthly recurrence.

- **Specific day**: The 15th of each month, good for mid-month bills.
- **Nth weekday**: The first Tuesday, third Friday, last Monday, etc, useful for variable schedules.

## 1.6 Quarterly Recurrence

Same options as monthly, but transactions repeat every 3 months.

- Quarterly tax payments
- Annual insurance payments, every 3 months
- Seasonal expenses

## 1.7 Yearly Recurrence

Specify the month and day.

- Annual subscription renewals
- Holiday bonuses
- Car registration or license renewal

## 1.8 Best Practices For Recurrence

- Use recurrence for all repeating payments to reduce data entry.
- Be specific about days and dates for accuracy.
- Review recurrence patterns before generating projections.
- Use periodic changes to handle salary increases or expense adjustments.

## 1.9 Recurrence Plus Periodic Changes

Combine recurrence with periodic changes to model real-world scenarios like annual raises or inflation-adjusted expenses.

- Salary: Weekly recurrence plus 3 percent annual increase
- Rent: Monthly recurrence on the 1st, no change
- Utilities: Monthly recurrence plus 5 dollars seasonal adjustment
