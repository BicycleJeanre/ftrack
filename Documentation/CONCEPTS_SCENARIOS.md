# Scenario Planning

## 1.0 Scenario Planning

## 1.1 Using Scenarios Effectively

- **Baseline scenario**: Your current reality with existing income and expenses.
- **What-if scenarios**: Test changes like salary increases, new expenses, or big purchases.
- **Comparison**: Duplicate a scenario to keep the original as a reference.
- **Budget vs General**: Budget scenarios are for strict planning; General for open exploration.
- **Date ranges**: Set scenario windows to focus on specific time periods.

## 1.2 What Is A Scenario

A scenario is a complete financial plan or what-if situation. It contains its own set of accounts, transactions, and projections. You can have multiple scenarios to explore different possibilities without mixing your data.

## 1.3 Scenario Types

### 1.3.1 Budget Scenarios

A strict financial plan designed to control spending. Budget scenarios include all core sections: Accounts, Transactions, Budget grid, and Projections.

Key features.

- **Budget Grid**: Define category-level spending limits and track against them.
- **Actual Transactions**: Record what you actually spend to compare against your plan.
- **Variance Tracking**: See how your actual spending compares to budgeted amounts.
- **Planned Transactions**: Model your expected income and expenses.

Best for: Monthly budget planning, expense control and monitoring, disciplined financial management.

### 1.3.2 General Scenarios

An open exploration scenario with more flexibility. General scenarios provide the core planning tools, Accounts, Transactions, Projections, without the strict budget tracking overhead.

General scenarios also include a compact Summary section at the top showing Money In, Money Out, and Net totals.

Note: The Budget grid is hidden in General scenarios.

Best for: Long-term financial planning, exploratory what-if analysis, modeling without strict budget constraints.

### 1.3.3 Debt Repayment Scenarios

A specialized scenario type optimized for tracking and modeling debt payoff strategies. Debt Repayment scenarios remove budget tracking and add summary cards that show key payoff metrics at a glance.

Summary cards include.

- **Per-Account Cards**: Current balance, projected end balance, payoff date, and total interest paid for each debt account.
- **Overall Total Card**: Aggregated totals across all debt accounts including total current debt, total projected end balance, total interest paid, and account count.

Debt Repayment scenarios include.

- **Summary Cards**: Quick overview of payoff progress and totals.
- **Accounts**: Define your debt accounts with balances and interest rates.
- **Transactions**: Model your payment strategy, planned transactions only, actual transactions are hidden.
- **Projections**: Month-by-month payoff schedule showing interest, payments, and remaining balance.

Note: Budget grid and Actual Transactions sections are hidden in Debt Repayment scenarios as they are not relevant for debt payoff modeling.

Using Debt Repayment scenarios.

1. **Create the scenario**: Select Debt Repayment from the scenario type dropdown.
2. **Add your debts**: In the Accounts section, add each debt with its current balance and interest rate such as Visa CC 5,000 dollars at 18 percent APR.
3. **Define payments**: In the Transactions section, add your planned monthly payments for each debt.
4. **Generate projections**: Click Generate Projections to see your month-by-month payoff schedule.
5. **Review summary cards**: Check the summary cards to see payoff dates, total interest, and progress.
6. **Experiment**: Adjust payment amounts to see how increasing payments affects payoff date and total interest paid.

Example: Paying off two debts.

- Visa CC: 5,000 dollars at 18 percent APR
- Student Loan: 10,000 dollars at 5 percent APR
- Payment Strategy: 250 dollars per month to Visa, 100 dollars per month to Student Loan

### 1.3.4 Funds Scenarios

Funds scenarios model a shared pool of assets with ownership expressed as shares per investor.

Funds scenarios include a Summary section at the top with.

- NAV, total shares, and share price.
- Money In, Money Out, and Net totals.
- A scope selector to view All, Asset, Liability, Equity, Income, or Expense views.

NAV uses standard accounting: Assets minus Liabilities.

Shares are always calculated automatically from transactions and are read-only.

Equity scope shows an investor breakdown including shares, ownership percent, and implied value.

Note: The Budget grid is hidden in Funds scenarios.

### 1.3.5 Advanced Goal Solver Scenarios

Advanced Goal Solver scenarios support multi-goal planning under user-defined constraints.

Advanced Goal Solver scenarios include.

- **Generate Plan**: Define multiple goals and constraints, then solve and apply suggested transactions.
- **Projections**: Validate results by generating projections after applying a solution.

## 1.4 Creating A Scenario

1. Click the Forecast button in the navbar.
2. Click Create Scenario.
3. Enter a descriptive name such as Baseline 2025.
4. Choose the type: Budget, General, Funds, Debt Repayment, Goal-Based, or Advanced Goal Solver.
5. Choose the period type (Day, Week, Month, Quarter, or Year).
6. Optionally set start and end dates for the scenario window.
7. Click Create.

Note: Accounts and Transactions are enabled after the scenario has both a Type and a Period Type.

## 1.5 Building Your Scenarios

### 1.5.1 Start With Baseline

Create one scenario that represents your current reality with actual accounts and transactions. This is your reference point.

### 1.5.2 Build What If Scenarios

Duplicate your baseline and modify it to explore different situations.

- **Conservative**: Lower income, higher expenses.
- **Optimistic**: Higher income, lower expenses.
- **Job change**: New salary and expenses.
- **Large purchase**: Add a major expense and see impact.
- **Debt payoff**: Model paying off a loan early.

### 1.5.3 Compare Results

Generate projections for each scenario and compare.

- Which scenario has the healthiest ending balance.
- Which has the smoothest cash flow.
- When do accounts run low in each scenario.
- What trade-offs are involved.

## 1.6 Scenario Best Practices

- Name clearly: Use descriptive names like Baseline Q1 2025 or If I Save 500 dollars per month.
- Keep one baseline: Always maintain your baseline as a reference.
- Duplicate smartly: Start new scenarios by duplicating baseline to save setup time.
- Document changes: Keep notes on what makes each scenario different.
- Review dates: Set appropriate start and end dates for scenario windows.
- Update regularly: Sync your baseline with reality at least weekly.

## 1.7 Managing Multiple Scenarios

FTrack allows you to manage multiple scenarios without data corruption. Each scenario maintains its own.

- Account balances
- Planned transactions
- Actual transactions
- Projections

## 1.8 Scenario Workflow Example

1. Create My Budget 2025 as your baseline.
2. Add all your real accounts and current balances.
3. Add planned income and expenses.
4. Generate projections and review.
5. Duplicate to create If I Get a Raise.
6. Update salary and recalculate.
7. Compare results to see the impact.
8. Create Conservative Case with lower income.
9. Compare all three scenarios to understand your range of outcomes.
