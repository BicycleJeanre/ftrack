# Budget Workflow

## 1.0 Purpose

1.1 Explain how to use the Budget workflow to plan spending, track actuals, and iterate using budgets and projections.

## 2.0 When To Use Budget

2.1 Use Budget when you want.

2.1.1 An editable budget grid to plan and track spending.

2.1.2 To record actual transactions and compare plan vs actual.

2.1.3 Plan vs actual comparisons and variance analysis.

2.2 If you do not need budgets and actuals, consider the General workflow.

## 3.0 Use the Budget Workflow

3.1 Go to Forecast.

3.2 Select the Budget workflow in the left nav.

3.3 Create a scenario.

3.4 Set Period Type to Month in most cases.

3.5 Set Start and End dates for the projection window.

## 4.0 Build Your Plan

4.1 Add accounts.

4.2 Add planned transactions (both recurring and non-recurring).

4.2.1 Income transactions.

4.2.2 Recurring bills and expenses.

4.2.3 Non-recurring one-time transactions.

4.3 Generate projections to see expected balances and cash flow.

## 5.0 Generate Budget From Planned Transactions

5.1 Add planned transactions with recurrence to your scenario.

5.1.1 Transactions must have a recurrence pattern (even one-time transactions count).

5.2 Click **Regenerate from Planned Transactions** button in the Budget tab.

5.2.1 The button will expand all recurrence-based transactions into dated budget occurrences.

5.2.2 Budget uses its own independent window dates, separate from projections.

5.3 Review the Budget grid.

5.3.1 Each expanded budget occurrence can be edited individually.

5.3.2 Planned amounts can be changed for specific occurrences.

5.3.3 Actual amounts can be recorded as the period progresses.

## 6.0 Track Actual Transactions

6.1 Use the Budget grid to record what actually happened.

6.2 Mark budget occurrences as "actual" and enter the actual amount and date.

6.3 Compare planned vs actual to identify variances and refine future budgets.

## 7.0 Regenerate Projections From Budget

7.1 After editing the Budget grid, you can regenerate projections using the budget as the source.

7.2 This allows budget actuals and edits to flow into the projection.

## 8.0 Key Differences: Budget Window vs Projection Window

8.1 Budget window: Independent date range used for expanding recurrence-based transactions into budget occurrences.

8.2 Projection window: Independent date range used for generating cash flow projections and account balances.

8.3 These are completely separate; changing one does not affect the other.

8.4 Budget window is required; projections are optional.

## 9.0 Troubleshooting

9.1 If budgets do not appear.

9.1.1 Confirm the selected workflow is Budget.

9.1.2 Add planned transactions with recurrence patterns to the scenario.

9.1.3 Configure a budget window (set start and end dates for budget regeneration).

9.1.4 Click "Regenerate from Planned Transactions" to expand transactions into budget occurrences.

9.2 "Regenerate from Planned Transactions" button shows an error.

9.2.1 Ensure you have added planned transactions with recurrence patterns.

9.2.2 Budget window must be configured with both start and end dates.
