# Compound Interest and Annuity Formulas

## 1. Compound Interest (Future Value)
- **Formula:**
  FV = PV × (1 + r/n)^(n×t)
- **Where:**
  - FV = future value
  - PV = present value (initial principal)
  - r = annual interest rate (decimal)
  - n = number of compounding periods per year
  - t = number of years

## 2. Compound Interest (Present Value)
- **Formula:**
  PV = FV / (1 + r/n)^(n×t)

## 3. Future Value of an Ordinary Annuity
- **Formula:**
  FV = P × [((1 + r/n)^(n×t) - 1) / (r/n)]
- **Where:**
  - P = payment per period
  - r = annual interest rate (decimal)
  - n = number of compounding periods per year
  - t = number of years

## 4. Present Value of an Ordinary Annuity
- **Formula:**
  PV = P × [1 - (1 + r/n)^(-n×t)] / (r/n)

## 5. Future Value of an Annuity Due
- **Formula:**
  FV = P × [((1 + r/n)^(n×t) - 1) / (r/n)] × (1 + r/n)

## 6. Present Value of an Annuity Due
- **Formula:**
  PV = P × [1 - (1 + r/n)^(-n×t)] / (r/n) × (1 + r/n)

## 7. Perpetuity (Infinite Annuity)
- **Formula:**
  PV = P / r
- **Where:**
  - P = payment per period
  - r = interest rate per period

## 8. Effective Annual Rate (EAR)
- **Formula:**
  EAR = (1 + r/n)^(n) - 1

---

**Notes:**
- For annuity due, payments are made at the beginning of each period; for ordinary annuity, at the end.
- Adjust n and r for different compounding frequencies (monthly, quarterly, etc.).
- These formulas are standard in finance for savings, loans, and investment calculations.
